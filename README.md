When parsing spot prices from exchanges, there are many "unnecessary" tokens. Either they are not available on the exchange, or their liquidity is such that the price does not change even within a day. This algorithm fetches prices and saves them to a file. After several hours, the script will request prices again and compare which tokens have unchanged prices. These tokens will be moved to the "bucket" folder by the system.
